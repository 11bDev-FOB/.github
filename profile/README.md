# 🪖 11b Dev FOB (Forward Operating Base) ⚡

```ruby

    @motto = "Adapt and Overcome"
    @stack = ["Ruby", "Rails", "Coffee", "More Coffee"]
    @mission_status = "Building tools that actually work"
  end

## 🎯 **MISSION BRIEFING**

**Call Sign:** 11b Dev  
**Status:** Actively Deployed from a Hippie Van 🚐  
**Objective:** Battle-tested code, crafted with soul  
**Rules of Engagement:** No AI fluff, no blockchain nonsense, no "disruption" - just useful software  

We left the Army but kept the mission-first mentality. From the Infantry to the terminal, we bring discipline and creativity to every line of code. **Hoorah, Oorah, Hooah** - whatever you said back in the day. 🇺🇸

## 🏛️ **SHRINE TO THE RUBY GODS**

*In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with Matz, and the Word was Ruby.*

```ruby
# Blessed be the elegant syntax
def praise_ruby
  puts "Ruby makes developers happy! 😊"
  yield if block_given?
end

praise_ruby { puts "All hail the principle of least surprise!" }
```

**Sacred Texts:**
- The Pickaxe Book (our field manual)
- The Ruby Way (our code of conduct)
- Why's (Poignant) Guide (our spiritual guidance)

## 🕵️ **THE MYSTERY OF _WHY**

```ruby
class WhyTheLuckyStiff
  def disappearance_date
    "August 19, 2009"
  end
  
  def legacy
    [
      "Shoes GUI toolkit",
      "Hpricot HTML parser", 
      "The most poignant guide ever written",
      "A chunky bacon meme",
      "Proof that programming is art"
    ]
  end
  
  def current_location
    "∞" # Still out there, somewhere in the interwebs
  end
end
```

*Some say he's still out there, teaching foxes to code...*  
*Others believe he became one with the Ruby source...*  
*We just know he made programming magical.* ✨

## 🤝 **RULES OF ENGAGEMENT (Contributing)**

1. **Check Your Six** - Review your code like your battle buddy's life depends on it
2. **KISS Principle** - Keep It Simple, Soldier
3. **No Man Left Behind** - Help other developers, always
4. **Secure Communications** - Write tests, document your code
5. **Mission First** - Solve real problems for real people

```ruby
# The 11b Dev way
def contribute(passion:, respect:, coffee: true)
  return "Welcome to the team! 🎖️" if passion && respect
  return "Needs more coffee ☕" unless coffee
  "Try again, recruit"
end
```

## 🌟 **OPEN SOURCE ETHOS**

**"Information wants to be free, and code wants to help people."**

We believe in:
- 🔓 **Open Source First** - Share knowledge like we shared MREs
- 🤝 **Community Over Competition** - We had each other's backs downrange
- 🛡️ **Quality Over Quantity** - One good tool beats a dozen broken ones
- 💎 **Ruby for Life** - Because beautiful code is a force multiplier

### 🔐 **CLASSIFIED OPERATIONS (Private Repos)**

```ruby
# Reality check from the field
class MilitaryRealism
  def open_source_love
    "We give back to the community because it's the right thing to do"
  end
  
  def private_repo_reality
    "Sometimes a soldier's gotta eat, and clients need their secret sauce 🍝"
  end
  
  def balance
    "Open source by heart, pragmatic by necessity"
  end
end
```

Look, we'd love to open-source everything, but MREs don't pay for themselves. Some of our repos are private because:
- **Client missions are classified** - NDAs are real, just like they were in the service
- **Rent money** - We're veterans, not trust fund babies
- **Competitive advantage** - Sometimes you need to keep your battle plans under wraps

**The Deal:** We contribute to open source whenever possible, but we also build proprietary solutions that keep the lights on and the coffee brewing. It's not selling out - it's strategic operations. ⚔️
